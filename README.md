To use, compile the probability calculator. After compiling, run the executable with the arguments in this order: executable "p" "k" "n". 
p is a number between 0 and 1 representing the probability of some event happening.
k is the number of times that the event being calculated happens out of n attempts.
Replace k with ! to calculate the chance of the event happening atleast once in n attempts.
Replace k with ? to calculate every chance of the event happening from 0 to n.
n is the number of times the event will be run.

The answer will be in the format of "Answer: " probability from 0-1 " / "  probability as a percentage
